# GitHub Actions Workflows

These workflows are currently disabled in favor of manual deployment.

To deploy the project:
1. Use the `deploy-hosting.bat` (Windows) or `deploy-hosting.sh` (Mac/Linux) script in the root directory
2. This will build and deploy only the hosting part to Firebase

Note: Cloud Functions deployment requires the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan.
